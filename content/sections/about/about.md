Caution. These lines are probably out of date by the time you read them. Just like the topics in my blog. Why I wrote about you? Two reasons either I was so interested in something that I wanted to write about it OR I was just bored and out of frustration I had no other idea than to write something here.

What remains is me, Florian Handke. Originally I did an apprenticeship as a precision mechanic, then studied production engineering in Bachelor and Master. After a long time of being mechanical, today a lot is digital. I program in R, Python, dart and if necessary also in Bash and if completely necessary also some websites.

Otherwise I like to be in the world of mechanical engineering and automation: processes, optimizations and everything that comes with it.
