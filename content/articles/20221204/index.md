Writing a blog is like writing a diary: Starting feels like changing your mind, being self-confident with writing things down and have the plan to get your thoughts on paper regular.

This is my third blog and I started countless diaries. Maybe that's human nature or more specific my nature. My future self will maybe read this post in a few years and think about it as a new starting point for a new project. Not adding stuff t the old one, but creating an entirely new one, with the same plans I had on 2022-12-04.

Starting something new always feels good: the spirit of change and possibilities. In the end it is about getting things done and keeping them alive. 

Sounds like a **bullshit** post on LinkedIn which tries to polish a personal brand ðŸ¤®. LinkedIn and it's high performers seem to be the same like a Popstar for a teenager. With your "limited" mind you think that this person must be a god like person with skills only achieved over years and a personality that is well shaped.
You try to copy habits and then realize that you do not have the same endurance.

Sitting in front of the same problem in your code for two days doesn't feel as heroic but also needs to done. Thinking about it over and over again trying hundret of possible solutions and then finding solution 101 on stackoverflow. Not a story for a LinkedIn post or a resume but reality. 

In this sense: Have fun with what you do and don't take the world as serious as it seems to be.
